We work on improving Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the\nexisting fortran-lang website. The format for our\ncontributions is a sequence of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons. The Fortran index documentation pages provide information\nabout the hackathon series, how the hackathons work, how to get involved, and\nupcoming and past events.

The funding will be used to attend the third Back to the Fortran Future workshop\nand the Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop in Belfast\nin April 2026. The goal of attending these events is to expand the contributor\nbase for Fortran index. In particular, it would be beneficial to have insight\nfrom web developers and those with community sites for programming languages\nother than Fortran. The funding will also be used to host the first ever in-person Fortran index\nhackathon in Cambridge, UK, in autumn 2026. This will coincide with a birthday\nparty to mark 70 years since the first document related to Fortran was\npublished. More details related to these events will be posted in due course.","tags":"","url":"page/funding.html"},{"title":"Hackathons – Fortran index","text":"Hackathon guide Contents Upcoming and past events Setup","tags":"","url":"page/hackathons/index.html"},{"title":"Upcoming and past events – Fortran index","text":"Events Information related to upcoming and past Fortran index events can be found in\nthe table below.

Once you've been added, you will be able to\nclone the fortran-lang-webpage fork of https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage . Beware that a straightforward clone of this fork will pull the entire Git\nhistory of the website, which is more than 50 GB.
