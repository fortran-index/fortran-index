## Funding

In January 2026, Fortran index lead organiser Joe Wallwork was awarded a
Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE)
[fellowship](https://www.cake.ac.uk/ke-fellowships/cohort1#joe-wallwork) to
further the aims of the hackathon series.

The funding will be used to attend the third Back to the Fortran Future workshop
and the Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop in Belfast
in April 2026. The goal of attending these events is to expand the contributor
base for Fortran index. In particular, it would be beneficial to have insight
from web developers and those with community sites for programming languages
other than Fortran.

The funding will also be used to host the first ever in-person Fortran index
hackathon in Cambridge, UK, in autumn 2026. This will coincide with a birthday
party to mark 70 years since the first document related to Fortran was
published. More details related to these events will be posted in due course.
