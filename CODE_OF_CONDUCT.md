# Code of conduct

We follow the code of conduct of the Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange
(CAKE) network: https://www.cake.ac.uk/CAKEbox/code-of-conduct/.

All participants in Fortran index hackathons must read this page and agree to
its terms.

In case of any breaches of the code of conduct, please contact one of the
event facilitators directly. The facilitators for a particular event will be
stated at the beginning of the session. Depending on the severity of the breach
of the code of conduct, the offending participant will either be given a warning
or will be excluded from the event.
