# Strategy session within Back to the Fortran Future 2 workshop (2025-09-08)

The Back to the Fortran Future 2 satellite event of RSECon had a dedicated
session on Fortran index, in which we presented the concept and hosted break-out
discussion groups. We asked attendees to visit the
[fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org) website and to provide their opinions
on four discussion prompts:

1. What would the best possible community resource for Fortran look like?
2. Discuss key topics, resources, packages, etc. people think are missing from
   the fortran-lang community resource.
3. Discuss sections, metadata, etc. people think are not currently presented in
   the best way in fortran-lang.
4. Suggest specific work packages for future Fortran index hackathons that could
   be achieved by 10 people in 2.5 hours.

This feedback is being used to shape the hackathon series going forward.

Number of attendees: ~40
