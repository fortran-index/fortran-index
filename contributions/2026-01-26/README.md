# Hackathon 5 (2026-01-26)

This hackathon is organised in collaboration with the [Special Interest Group
for Reasonable Performance Computing (SIG-RPC)](https://sig-rpc.github.io/).
During the event, we'll contribute training material on common Fortran
optimisation patterns to the
[SIG-RPC webpage](https://sig-rpc.github.io/optimisations/fortran/) to help
improve the efficiency of researchers' Fortran code.
