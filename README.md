# Fortran index

Fortran index is an initiative born out of the
[Back to the Fortran Future](https://lu.ma/ao471jms) satellite event of
[RSECon 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/). Our mission is to make it
easier for Fortran users and developers to find useful resources, such as tools,
documentation, training materials... and anything else Fortran-related.

We will improve Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the existing
[fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) website. The format will be a sequence
of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons.

### Code of conduct

We follow the Society of RSE

### Setup

To set yourself up for contributing to Fortran index in one of the hackathons,
provide your GitHub username to one of the organisers, who will add you to the
`fortran-index` GitHub organisation. Once you've been added, you will be able to
clone the
[`fortran-lang-webpage`](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-lang-webpage)
fork of https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage.

Beware that a strightforward clone of this fork will pull the entire Git history
of the website, which is more than 50 GB. Instead, clone using
```
git clone --filter=blob:none git@github.com:fortran-index/fortran-lang-webpage.git
```
or
```
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:fortran-index/fortran-lang-webpage.git
```

### Contact

If you're interested in participating in a Fortran index hackathon, please get
in touch with Joe Wallwork ([@jwallwork23](https://github.com/jwallwork23),
jw2423@cam.ac.uk).
