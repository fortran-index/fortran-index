# Fortran index

Fortran index is an initiative borne out of the
[Back to the Fortran Future](https://lu.ma/ao471jms) satellite event of
[RSECon 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/). Our mission is to make it
easier for Fortran users and developers to find useful resources, such as tools,
documentation, training materials... and anything else Fortran-related.

We will improve Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the existing
[fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) website. The format will be a sequence
of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons.

### Code of conduct
