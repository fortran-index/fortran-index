# Fortran index

*Fortran index* is an initiative born out of the
[Back to the Fortran Future][BTTFF1] satellite event of [RSECon 2024][RSECon24].
Our mission is to make it easier for Fortran users and developers to find useful
resources, such as tools, documentation, training materials... and anything else
Fortran-related.

We work on improving Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the
existing [fortran-lang][fortran-lang] website. The format for our contributions
is a sequence of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons.

The Fortran index [documentation pages](https://fortran-index.github.io) provide
information about the hackathon series, how the hackathons work, how to get
involved, and upcoming and past events.
