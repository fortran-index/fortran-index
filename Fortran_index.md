Description
-----------

*Fortran index* is an initiative born out of the
[Back to the Fortran Future][BTTFF1] satellite event of [RSECon 2024][RSECon24].
Our mission is to make it easier for Fortran users and developers to find useful
resources, such as tools, documentation, training materials... and anything else
Fortran-related.

We work on improving Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the
existing [fortran-lang][fortran-lang] website. The format for our contributions
is a sequence of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons.

Code of conduct
---------------

We follow the [code of conduct](https://www.cake.ac.uk/CAKEbox/code-of-conduct/)
of the Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) network. See the
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file for more details.
