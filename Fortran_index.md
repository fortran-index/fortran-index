Description
-----------

*Fortran index* is an initiative born out of the
[Back to the Fortran Future](https://lu.ma/ao471jms) satellite event of
[RSECon 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/).
Our mission is to make it easier for Fortran users and developers to find useful
resources, such as tools, documentation, training materials... and anything else
Fortran-related.

We work on improving Fortran indexing by making group contributions to the
existing [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) website. The format for our
contributions is a sequence of semi-regular 2.5-hour hackathons.

The Fortran index [documentation pages](|page|/index.html) provide information
about the hackathon series, how the hackathons work, how to get involved, and
upcoming and past events.
